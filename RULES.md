Notes:

(Maps been changed to randomise for online version)
- Similar play style to Battleship but with more of a purpose.
Introducing real world maps & new “Missions” where scenarios are proposed in order to win points. 
(E.g. 
Map of Italy with the “Mission” to invade Sardinia - meaning get all your ships to Sardinia Map of France with “Mission” to destroy all enemy tanks
)- Various Units, use your points won from previous “campaigns” to purchase different units.
- Special power cards, purchased before each new campaign similarly to purchasing new units
e.g. Radar which reveals the location of an enemy ship.
AND Special Side Missions e.g. +10 points for destroying every enemy battleship

Guide:
- BattleShip but played on real world maps overlayed with a grid. - Units = Ships or land figures.
- Different Units have different points E.g. 
People carrier = 10 points but is only has a length of 1 and can only move 1 place per turn
Battleship = 5 points but has a length of 4 and can move 3 places per turn. 

Rules:
- Units have to be placed along the edge of the map.
- You can move every unit every round. (No Diagonal Movements has to be connected squares) - Fire 3 shots perturb
- Each side can only use 8 units.
- Place units before knowing the mission
- Special Cards only last for that campaign.
- Turns -> Fire then Move or play Power Card (Can only use 1 Power Card per turn)
- Announce ship arrival to destination but not announce the specific ship name.
- To win the round whoever gets the most points per Units to the destination.
- Points & accumulate over rounds.
